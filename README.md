So this is my personal website. It's pretty cool because it exists as a node package. I wanted to use bower for dependencies, but didn't. Go explore the code and ask questions if you like!

## Things I used

* Git (duh)
* Grunt
* Node.js
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* CoffeeScript
* Jade (just because)
* SASS
* Photoshop
* My imagination
* Fun :D
